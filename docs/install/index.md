# Install Plone 6

## Getting started

* What do you want to do?
  * Try a demo now
  * Run Plone in containers (why use containers here..)
  * Develop Plone add-ons or contribute to Plone packages â†’ Install Plone from source


## Caveat that Plone is a large project and source installs are non-trivial
