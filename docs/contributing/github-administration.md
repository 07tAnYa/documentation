## Repository tagging

To easily find repositories and what's their purpose within the Plone organization,
a set of tags are being set on repositories within the Plone GitHub organization.

The tags are so far:

- `core`: any repository that are installed when doing a volto or a classic ui project, i.e. what's shared between the two
- `volto`: specific repositories that are meant to get volto running
- `volto add-ons`: repositories not part of default volto UI/UX but meant for it
- `classic ui`: counterpart to volto tag
- `classic ui add-ons`: counterpart to volto add-ons
- `documentation`: repositories that have documentation
- `training`: repositories related to the training documentation
- `infrastructure`: repositories used for all about maintaining Plone servers
- `tooling`: tools / apps needed to orchestrate Plone
